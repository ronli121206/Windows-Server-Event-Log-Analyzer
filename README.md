Author: Ronald Li (ronald.li.121206@gmail.com)

This program scans the Windows Event Logs of a Windows server to analyze for security events. Logs must be exported in csv format.
The program can perform the following functionality: 
1. Scan for all users that logged into the domain
2. Given a username, look for the IP Addresses and Workstations where that user has logged in from
3. Search for any user accounts that may have been compromised by a bruteforce attack
